# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: 
  title: "Task one"
  content: "Task one desc"
  priority: <%= Date.tomorrow %>
  category: one
  user: one

two: 
  title: "Task two"
  content: "Task two desc"
  priority: <%= Date.tomorrow %>
  category: two
  user: two
